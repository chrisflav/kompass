# jdav Kompass

![Build Status](https://github.com/chrisflav/kompass/actions/workflows/build-docker.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Kompass is an administration platform designed for local sections of the Young German Alpine Club. It provides
tools to contact and (automatically) manage members, groups, material, excursions and statements.

For more details on the features, see the (German) [documentation](https://jdav-hd.de/static/docs/index.html).

If you are interested in using the Kompass in your own local section, please get in touch via
email at `name of this project`@`merten.dev`. We are very happy to discuss how the Kompass can be used in
your setting.
